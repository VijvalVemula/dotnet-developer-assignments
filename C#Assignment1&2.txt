Understanding Data Types |
--------------------------
Q1.
a. String
b. float or double
c. Int
d. enum
e. decimal
f. float or double
g. long
h. long
i. int
----------------------------------
Q2. 
Value type variables:
- Stores data
- Stored in stack memory
- Eg: int, float, double
- Memory allocation is automatic based on the scope of the variable

Reference type variables:
- stores address of the data's memory loc.
- Stored in head memory
- eg: class, string, array
- Required garbage collection for memory cleaning and management.

Boxing:
- Value type variables >>> Reference type variables
- Eg: int n = 10;
      object boxedNum = n;

Unboxing:
- Exact opposite of boxing: Ref type >>> val type
- Eg: object boxedNum = 10;
      int n = (int)boxedNum; 
-------------------------------------
Q3:
Managed resources:
- Resources that are controlled and cleaned up by the .NET Runtime
- Eg: Array, strings, lists

Unmanaged resources:
- They require explicit clean up, .NET runtime does not do that.
- Eg: File handles, database connections, memory allocated via external libraries
-------------------------------------
Q4:
Garbage collector cleans up the memory by automatically deallocating the memory to un-used objects. 
It is important to clean up the space, and to prevent memory leaks.
